# Template

Stuff like modals. Directive and Component Templates should be stored in the 
same directory as the JavaScript they support. Always think Directive or 
Component unless the externality compels you. A typical external condition
tends to involve strict making an AJAX call which demands a Template in 
virtue of those DOM Event. So, arbitrary DOM events, or more broadly speaking
internaction models, which entail the presentation of complex HTML.

## Ideas

1. Modals
2. Panels
3. Frame-likes
4. Overrides (for other plugins)
5. Stuff you cannot think to put in a Directive or Component
